To create good user centered wikis, you need to look at the pain points of the users.
What are they used to using now?
Is this going to be a team collaboration site?

I have just finished a stint at a company that can't decide what it is using the wiki for. Knowledge base? Training platform? 
Anything but collaboration - even though, that's what it was designed for.
